# Kickstarter Analysis
1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
Given the provided data, the first conclusion we can draw regarding these Kickstarter campaigns is that theater is the category with the most successful campaigns.

The second conclusion we can draw is that the category of music is the second most popular category; it may be a more solid investment than theater given the fact that its sustainability for success is throughout the year, not only in the summer months, where theater investments tend to spike.

The last conclusion we can draw from Kickstarter campaigns is that the best measure of success is not only by the category of the campaign, but the sub-category of the campaign. The best way to measure success of a campaign is by its subcategory. For example, the following campaigns in the subcategories below had 100% successful campaigns.

2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations to this dataset are that there is no measure on the return on investment for these campaigns. Stating that these campaigns are successful does not equate to any profitability for the campaigns as a whole. Another limitation is that the data does not show the sustainability for any of these campaigns, as tastes change, so will the popularity and profitability of the campaigns. So, what is popular at the current time, may not be popular five years from now. So, the data is limited in that projections can only be made from data ranging from 2009 until today. While that may be a good measure of growth for the short term, it may not work when making long-term projections.
3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
You could make a graph/table showing the most popular categories without significant outliers, that would be a truer projection of success, because you have eliminated data that may have skewed the data set. 
You could create a graph that shows the Categories that require the most capital to be successful.
A graph could be created showing the most successful campaigns by country, so campaigners would know which category would be most successful in their home country.
